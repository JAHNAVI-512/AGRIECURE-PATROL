# AGRISECURE-PATROL
Presently most farmers use scarecrows as a mannequin. This method is not very effective since most birds see right through this ploy. Our robot can move around the field providing the impression that someone is on the lookout. 
Additionally, we have installed high accuracy sensors which produces a loud buzz and light flashes when it detects irregular activities like motion of birds, hence scaring them away rather efficiently. 
On its path it can also spray pesticides on the plants. This reduces human labor significantly and does the same job rather effectively.
The bot has been enhanced with additional features like:
	User Alerts to inform users of critical events.
	Multi-Functionality physical features that includes Seed Planting (functionality for planting seeds in addition to its pest control duties)
	And Irrigation System(Integrated with a system to provide targeted irrigation where needed)
	Maintenance Alerts
	Self-Diagnostics: Implement a self-diagnostic system to monitor the robot’s health and show alerts for maintenance.
	User Customization
	Configurable Parameters: Allow users to customize settings for movement speed, detection sensitivity, and pesticide spraying rates through an app or interface.
